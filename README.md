Apino
-----

Apino is a resilient backend as a service system that can scale with your application.

The scope is to be able to configure your API through a UI dashboard that when the changes
are published will generate all the files needed the create/list/show/update/delete these
entitites.

Motivation
==========

Currently there is no framework/service for Elixir that can allow you to build applications fast
through a user interface dedicated for non technical people or for developers who want to focus on
building a mobile app instead of the backend, but that can be extended with new functionality as the 
application grows with time.

The goal of the project is to be the start of such as system, similar to Parse Framework, Strapi or Firebase.

TODO/Improvements
=================
- DONE Generate basic app/app_web file structure
- DONE Generate migrations for entities/properties
- IN PROGRESS Generate models for entities/properties
- Update entities/properties based on the changes made to the db configuration instead of 
  recreating the all the generated code
- Allow the user to change the configuration params of the generated app
- Auto restart the generated apps once a new deploy was made
- Generate the entire app outside the current application

Usage
=====

First create the database and start the application.

  ```bash
  # start the postgres database on port 15432 using Docker or locally with the same details
  docker-compose -p apino up -d
  # start the apino server
  mix phx.server
  ```

Then use the information in the /docs folder to call the API and define entities and properties.

A Postman collection is available in the folder with request/response examples and a db export 
in CSV format shows my test configuration. You can download postman from their 
website https://www.getpostman.com/ or you can also run the endpoints using curl.

Use the /api/publish endpoint to generate the app based on your database entity/property configuration.

You can also start the app using `iex -S mix phx.server` and then run `Apino.Generator.CreateApp.deploy(:fresh)`.
After the files are generated you can exit the server and restart it using `iex -S mix phx.server`.

Currently the application does not overwrite any files previously generated so you will need to 
remove the existing apps first before calling the /publish endpoint again.
